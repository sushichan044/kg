# Domain Modeling Checklist

Reference: [`../../kamae/SKILL.md` §1](../../kamae/SKILL.md), [`../../kamae/domain-modeling.md`](../../kamae/domain-modeling.md), and the project's validation library guide under [`../../kamae/validation-libraries/`](../../kamae/validation-libraries/).

## 1.1 Are domain states modeled as Discriminated Unions? — Medium

Flag: a single type with many `optional` properties and a `string` state field (e.g. `{ state: string; driverId?: string; startTime?: Date }`). Suggest splitting into per-state types unioned together so state-specific properties become required.

## 1.2 Is `kind` used as the unified discriminant? — Low

Flag: discriminant property names other than `kind` (`type`, `status`, `state`, `_tag`, …). Suggest renaming to `kind` for codebase consistency.

## 1.3 Are classes used for domain models? — Medium

If `class` defines domain entities or value objects, suggest migrating to Discriminated Union + Companion Object. Class inheritance required by an external library is a legitimate exception.

## 1.4 Is the Companion Object pattern followed? — Medium

Check that:

- A type's related operations live on a `const` of the same name as the type.
- Branded Type validation schemas are exposed as `.schema` on the companion object, not as standalone `XxxSchema` exports.
- Domain logic is not scattered as free-standing `xxxAssignDriver` helpers when a companion object would naturally own them.

## 1.5 Is `interface` used for domain types? — Low

Declaration merging silently changes a type's shape. Domain types must be `type`. `interface` is acceptable only for library type augmentation.

## 1.6 Is method notation used inside type definitions? — Low

Method notation (`save(task: Task): Promise<void>`) makes parameters bivariant, allowing a narrower implementation (`save(task: DoingTask): …`) to type-check at injection sites. Suggest function property notation (`save: (task: Task) => Promise<void>`).

## 1.7 Are Branded Types applied to semantically distinct primitives? — High

Flag: `string` / `number` used directly for IDs and semantically distinct values (`UserId`, `OrderId`, `Email`, money amounts, …). Verify that brands use the validation library's brand feature when one is present (so `as` casts are unnecessary), or the `unique symbol` pattern when no library is used.

## 1.8 Are domain objects `Readonly<>`? — Low

Flag: domain object types defined without `Readonly<…>` (or `readonly` per-property). State changes should produce new objects, not mutate properties.

## 1.9 Is the "one concept per file" rule followed? — Medium

Flag: catch-all files (`types.ts`, `models.ts`, `domain.ts`) aggregating many domain types, especially when companion objects live elsewhere. Barrel files (`index.ts`) must only re-export.
